#  Strategic Recommendations: Budget Optimization

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Model Version:** `v1.0 (Calibrated-ADVI)`
**Objective:** Maximize Revenue under current budget constraints.

##  Executive Summary
We have identified an opportunity to increase daily revenue by **$83,713 (+4.8%)** without spending an additional dollar. This is achieved by reallocating the media budget from **TikTok** and **TV** towards **Google Search** and **Facebook**.

##  The Optimization Results

| Channel | Current Daily Spend | Recommended Spend | % Change | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google Search** | $1,636 | **$2,455** | **+50.0%** |  **Scale Aggressively** |
| **Facebook** | $2,184 | **$3,031** | **+38.8%** |  **Scale Up** |
| **TikTok** | $2,031 | **$1,015** | **-50.0%** | 🔻 **Cut Spend / Retest** |
| **TV** | $3,904 | **$3,254** | **-16.6%** | 🔻 **Trim for Efficiency** |
| **TOTAL** | **$9,755** | **$9,755** | **0.0%** | **Reallocation Only** |

**Projected Impact:**
-   **Current Revenue:** ~$1,755,352 (Daily Baseline)
-   **Optimized Revenue:** ~$1,839,066
-   **Net Lift:** **+$83,713 / day**

##  Strategic Rationale

### 1. The TikTok Correction (Calibration)
Initially, the correlational model might have over-valued TikTok. However, our **Geo-Lift Experiment in Melbourne** (Phase 3) revealed the *true* causal ROAS was closer to **3.5**.
-   **Insight:** We were over-spending on TikTok relative to its verified incremental impact.
-   **Action:** Reduce spend to the level where ROAS is maximized (~$1k/day).

### 2. Google Search Efficiency
Google Search has a high coefficient in our calibrated model. It is currently underspent, meaning we are on the steep part of the "S-Curve" (Hill Function).
-   **Insight:** Every extra dollar in Search yields arguably the highest return right now.
-   **Action:** Max out the budget cap (+50% constraint).

### 3. Saturation Management on TV
TV is our biggest line item (~$4k/day). While effective, the response curve suggests diminishing returns.
-   **Insight:** We can pull back ~17% of budget without significantly hurting topline, freeing up cash for digital growth.

##  Key Takeaways for Stakeholders
1.  **Stop "Spray and Pray":** We are moving from a flat spread to a performance-weighted allocation.
2.  **Trust the Experiment:** The drastic cut in TikTok isn't a guess; it's based on the Melbourne lift test.
3.  **Monitor Search:** As we scale Google +50%, watch for CPA inflation (checking if the Diminishing Returns kick in faster than modeled).
